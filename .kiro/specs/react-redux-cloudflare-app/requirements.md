# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a modern React application with Redux state management that can be deployed and hosted on Cloudflare Pages. The application will leverage Cloudflare's edge computing capabilities for optimal performance and global distribution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up a React application with Redux, so that I can build a scalable frontend application with predictable state management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL create a React application with TypeScript support
2. WHEN Redux is integrated THEN the system SHALL include Redux Toolkit for modern Redux patterns
3. WHEN the development environment is set up THEN the system SHALL provide hot reloading and development tools
4. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL generate optimized production bundles

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement Redux state management, so that I can manage application state in a predictable and maintainable way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Redux store is configured THEN the system SHALL use Redux Toolkit for store setup
2. WHEN state slices are created THEN the system SHALL follow Redux Toolkit slice patterns
3. WHEN async operations are needed THEN the system SHALL use Redux Toolkit Query or createAsyncThunk
4. WHEN components need state THEN the system SHALL use React-Redux hooks (useSelector, useDispatch)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy the application to Cloudflare Pages, so that users can access the application with global edge performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build configuration is set up THEN the system SHALL be compatible with Cloudflare Pages deployment
2. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL serve static assets from Cloudflare's edge network
3. WHEN users access the application THEN the system SHALL provide fast loading times through edge caching
4. WHEN deployment occurs THEN the system SHALL support automatic deployments from Git repository

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure routing and navigation, so that users can navigate between different pages of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN React Router is integrated THEN the system SHALL support client-side routing
2. WHEN users navigate THEN the system SHALL update the URL without full page reloads
3. WHEN invalid routes are accessed THEN the system SHALL display appropriate 404 pages
4. WHEN routing is configured THEN the system SHALL work correctly with Cloudflare Pages' routing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement proper error handling and loading states, so that users have a good experience even when things go wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms
4. WHEN the application crashes THEN the system SHALL use error boundaries to prevent complete failure

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize the application for production, so that it performs well and loads quickly for users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application builds THEN the system SHALL implement code splitting and lazy loading
2. WHEN assets are served THEN the system SHALL include proper caching headers
3. WHEN the bundle is analyzed THEN the system SHALL minimize bundle size
4. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL achieve good Core Web Vitals scores
